# Final-30
The Final 30 project included 2 projects. one was a clap switch and the other a traffic light. 

**Clap switch**
The leds turn off and on dependning on the sound it hears. In our case, in order for the clap switch to work, you needed to clap twice and it would turn on and off if it heard those sounds.

**Traffic light**
the traffic light basically alternates between 3 different colours. Green, red and yellow. It would first turn the red light on for a 5 seconds, then the yellow for 2 and the green for 10 and it would loop like that over and over again until the power supply is turned off.
